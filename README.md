# htmlify

## About

This tool converts images into HTML. It can be used to get 100% on almost any challenge on [CSS-Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/).

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxwellmatthis/htmlify.git
```

You may need to install `opencv-python` using pip.

## Troubleshooting

On MacOS, when conoverting images directly from URL you may run into a SSL-CERT validation error.

To fix this run the following command:

```bash
/Applications/Python\ 3.8/Install\Â Certificates.command
```

You may need to replace `3.8` with your version.
